# A Mchine Learning  Project🚀

Welcome to my data analysis and machine learning projects repository. This repository showcases two major projects: predicting bike rentals in Seoul using machine learning regression techniques, and classifying cosmic rays detected by the MAGIC telescope using machine learning classification methods.

## Overview

This project aims to predict bike rental demand in Seoul based on various environmental factors. The project uses machine learning regression models to transform raw data into valuable insights, aiding urban transportation planning and decision-making.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](http://data.seoul.go.kr/)
- **Description:** The dataset includes various features that impact bike rental demand, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and more.
