# MAGIC_DATA_PROJECT

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a machine learning project focused on a dataset with various attributes. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The goal is to provide a comprehensive example of building and evaluating machine learning models using Python and popular libraries.

## Features

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
